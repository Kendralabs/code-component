# code-component

> A code component for the [elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform"), runs a piece of a JavaScript code inside your integration flow.

## Documentation

Pretty much the same way that you would use any other component in our system. It is deployed by default to production,
so no need to deploy it yourself (although you could if you have extended it yourself). In our Dashboard
start building your integration and include the Code component as well. You will see a picture similar to the one below:

However, don't let the simple look fool you - it has a full-fledged interface with many very useful features like the ones you would expect from your favourite desktop developing tool:

 * Syntax highlighting - a standard for any online real-time coding interface
 * Code auto-completion - again a standard that you got used to from your desktop tool
 * Support for number of variables and libraries within the context of the execution
 * Support latest ECMAScript standard
 * Run and troubleshoot within the designer interface.
